# Howdy, rider!

Welcome to my personal space on the web! I'm Robin Sandhu, a software enginner navigating his way through life. Here you can find my small curated collection of thoughts, ideas and plans for my future. Nothing here is original as such, just a large concoction of all the things I have exprienced and learned so far.
